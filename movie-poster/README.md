# MoviePosterHTML

This project is a demonstration of how to convert an interesting movie poster, which contains a reasonable amount of textual content, into a web version using HTML and CSS. We selected a captivating movie poster and recreated the textual content using a variety of HTML elements.

The selected movie poster contains various text elements, including titles, synopsis, quotes, and other movie-related information.

## Project Structure

The "MoviePosterHTML" project is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the page structure and the HTML elements used to recreate the poster's content.

- `style.css`: The CSS file containing the page's styling, including colors, fonts, and element positioning.

- `images/`: A directory that stores the movie poster image.s
